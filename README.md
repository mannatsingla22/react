# React Network Topology Visualization

This project is a modern React app that visualizes a network topology using D3.js on a `<canvas>`. It features a mock authentication flow, a responsive UI, and unit tests with Jest.

## Features

- **D3.js Topology on Canvas**: Network topology is rendered using D3.js on a `<canvas>`, not SVG or JSX.
- **Correct Node Icons**: Each node type (tower, router, cluster, server, VM) uses a modern icon (PNG) from the `public/` folder.
- **Zoom, Pan, and Scroll**: Interactive zoom in/out and pan with D3. The canvas is scrollable, and page scroll is prevented during interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The topology loads fast and works well on all screen sizes.
- **Modern Login Page**: The login screen features a simple, modern background image (from Unsplash/Freepik) and shows only the login form at first.
- **Mock Authentication**: No real login or APIâ€”after clicking "Login," the topology screen is shown.
- **Unit Testing**: All UI unit test files are in `src/ui-tests/` and use the Jest framework.
